# Fullstack Boilerplate

## Available Scripts

In the root directory, you may run the following to install all dependencies:
### `npm run install:all`

Then, run the following in the root directory to spin up both the server and the client:
### `npm run dev`

This command will initiate both the server and the client.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the client in the browser.
The server will run at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

The server is ready to go with ES6 syntax, the client and server will reload automatically with any edits you make.<br />

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Please note:
In order to add dependencies to either `server` or `client`, run the `npm install` command inside their respective directories, NOT through the root directory, as each has its own seperate `package.json` and `node_modules`.
